delete button is working but the order is not coming as expected to do that we need to re render the whole row 


now the arrangemnt related problem is solved


trying to figure out how to delete a particular element from array 

got something called  setAttribute() method and getAttribute() method 


delete btn ke saath koi attribute add kr krhe hai ki track kr ske ki konsa btn click hua aur konsa todo task ko delete krna hai



getAttribute( attribute name  )  se attribute check kr skte hai ki konsa attribute hai uska value kya hai and all




setAttribute( kuch bhi naam dedo , attribute set kro  )




splice(arg1 , arg2) method ka knowledge

it takes 2 arguement --->  1st is index and 2nd is how many elements to delete from that specific index 




                //   for progress button


instread of pushing only tasks inside the array in the form of string we are creating object for each task and then pushing it inside an array 

this will help in changing the status of the todo task
